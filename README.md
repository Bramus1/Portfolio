# üéì Giuliano Taurone ‚Äì Academic Project Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! This repository contains a curated selection of academic projects I‚Äôve worked on during my Computer Science degree. These projects cover a wide range of domains, from artificial intelligence and
robotics to secure file sharing, games, and software architecture.

Each folder represents a distinct project, most of which are still under development or pending final refinement. They demonstrate my passion for building, experimenting, and solving real-world problems using code.

## üìÅ Projects Overview

- **AI Cart Pole**  
  Implementation of reinforcement learning techniques using OpenAI Gym environments.

- **Apolline**  
  A mobile application for environmental data collection, featuring BLE communication and sensor integration.

- **Flood-it**  
  A puzzle game inspired by the classic Flood-It logic, implemented as a fun exploration of game mechanics.

- **Matrix Confusion**  
  A tool for analyzing and visualizing confusion matrices, useful in evaluating machine learning models.

- **Othello**  
  A full implementation of the Othello board game, including AI strategies and a client-server structure.

- **Restaurant Application**  
  A multi-module C++ application for managing restaurant logistics: orders, kitchen, bar, and user authentication.

- **Robotic Arm**  
  Code for programming and controlling a **St√§ubli industrial robot**, including task automation and movement sequences.

- **Robotic Head**  
  A Raspberry Pi-based robotic head capable of audio interaction, camera-based object recognition, and movement.

- **Secure File Sharing**  
  A project exploring cryptographic methods and secure data exchange using Python and OpenSSL.

- **Tetris**  
  My take on the classic Tetris game, designed to reinforce my understanding of UI rendering and game state logic.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Languages:** Python, C++, Java, Dart, JavaScript, HTML  
- **Tools & Frameworks:** Raspberry Pi, Flutter, Qt, OpenAI Gym, BLE, OpenSSL  
- **Concepts:** AI/ML, Cryptography, Game Dev, Robotics, Mobile Development, Client-Server Architecture

## üìå Notes

- These are **academic and personal learning projects** ‚Äì some may still need updates or cleanup.
- I‚Äôve chosen to include them all in one repo for simplicity and as a living archive of my development journey.
